Hi, I'm @zanoudev

I'm interested in:
- Web dev, web design and UX (React)
- Machine learning and using AI tools (TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- Data analysis and visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)

I work primarily with Python and JavaScript.

Currently learning:
- Tableau, Power BI for advanced data visualization
- AWS cloud services
- Flask for rapid web development

Currently working on: Building a movie recommendation system using Python.

Pandas (for data manipulation)
NumPy (for numerical operations)
Surprise or LightFM (specialized recommendation libraries)
MongoDB or PostgreSQL (for database storage)
FastAPI (as an alternative to Flask for creating APIs)
